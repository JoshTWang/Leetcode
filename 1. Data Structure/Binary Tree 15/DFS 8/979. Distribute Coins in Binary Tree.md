## 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

---

Why post-order?

- We can easily determine the # of coins we should move on the leaf

#### My solution - simulation

```java
class Solution {
    int res;
    // return the coins we need to move from curr to the parent
    private int post_dfs(TreeNode curr) {
        if (curr.left != null) {
            curr.val += post_dfs(curr.left);
        }
        if (curr.right != null) {
            curr.val += post_dfs(curr.right);
        }
        this.res += Math.abs(curr.val - 1);
        return curr.val - 1;
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        post_dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
}


Same idea more concise:

class Solution {
    int res;
    // return the coins we need to move from curr to the parent
    private int post_dfs(TreeNode curr) {
        if (curr == null) 
            return 0;
         
        curr.val += post_dfs(curr.left) + post_dfs(curr.right);
        this.res += Math.abs(curr.val - 1);
        return curr.val - 1;
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        post_dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
}
```



#### Same idea but different detail

```java
class Solution {
    int res;
    // return the coins we need to move from curr to the parent
    private int post_dfs(TreeNode curr) {
        if (curr == null)
            return 0;

        int left = post_dfs(curr.left);
        int right = post_dfs(curr.right);
        this.res += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
        return curr.val + left + right - 1;
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        post_dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
}
```



In my solution, the tree will be changed. What we add to the result --  move[curr to curr's parent]

In Answer's solution, the tree is untouched. What we add to the result --  [curr's left to curr, curr's right to curr]
