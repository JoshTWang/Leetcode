Facebook interviewers like this question and propose it in four main variations. The choice of algorithm should be based on the input format:

1. Strings (the current problem). Use schoolbook digit-by-digit addition. Note, that to fit into constant space is not possible for languages with immutable strings, for example, for Java and Python. Here are two examples:
   - [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/articles/add-binary/): sum two binary strings.
   - [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/): sum two non-negative numbers in a string representation without converting them to integers directly.
2. Integers. Usually, the interviewer would ask you to implement a sum without using `+` and `-` operators. Use bit manipulation approach. Here is an example:
   - [371. Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/articles/sum-of-two-integers/): Sum two integers without using `+` and `-` operators. **unfinish**
3. Arrays. The same textbook addition. Here is an example:
   - [989. Add to Array Form of Integer](https://leetcode.com/articles/add-to-array-form-of-integer/). **unfinish**
4. Linked Lists. Sentinel Head + Textbook Addition. Here are some examples:
   - [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/articles/plus-one/).
   - [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/articles/add-two-numbers/).
   - [445. Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/). **unfinish**
