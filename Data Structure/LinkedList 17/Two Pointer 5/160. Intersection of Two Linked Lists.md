**Good question 8 / 10**

#### MySolution -- HashTable -- Naive

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        Set<ListNode> setA = new HashSet<>();
      	// iteration to memorize ListA
        while (headA != null) {
            setA.add(headA);
            headA = headA.next;
        }
      	// iteration to check whether ListB have nodes in ListA
        while (headB != null) {
            if (setA.contains(headB)) {
                return headB;
            }
            headB = headB.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
  //O(M + N)
  //O(M)
}
```



#### Two Pointer

* If two List have the intersection, they will end up with the same nodes and the same amount of the nodes.
* They trouble why we can't iterate the two List together is that they don't have the same length
* So if we calculate the length of ListA and List B then move the longer pointer to the head of the shorter pointer we will finally find the interaction node.
* 3 loops total



#### Crazy idea -- in one loop

* The algorithm is same as the two pointer but in 1 loop
* We create 2 pointer p1 points ListA and p2 points ListB
  * We iterate p1 and when p1 == null we change the p1 to point the head of ListB and move on 
  * We iterate p1 and when p1 == null we change the p1 to point the head of ListA and move on
  * In their 2 iteration, they will both iterate the distinctive part of both ListA and List B and will finally point to the same length from the tail. That's so good.

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode pA = headA;
        ListNode pB = headB;
        while (pA != pB) {
            pA = pA == null ? headB : pA.next;
            pB = pB == null ? headA : pB.next;
        }
        return pA;
        // Note: In the case lists do not intersect, the pointers for A and B
        // will still line up in the 2nd iteration, just that here won't be
        // a common node down the list and both will reach their respective ends
        // at the same time. So pA will be NULL in that case.
    }
}
```
