#### Naive Hashset

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head)) {
                return head;
            }
            set.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Floyd's Tortoise and Hare

![Diagram of cyclic list](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/Figures/142/Slide1.PNG)

Hare goes 2 steps, tortoise goes 1 step

Before cycle -- > **F**

Cycle -- > **C** 

**Toitoise comes to the start of the cycle, hare comes to 'h'**

1. When tortoise goes F steps, it comes to the cycle, at the same time hare goes 2F steps.
2. Hare's position **h** = (2F - F) mod C

**After C - h steps, they will meet at another position called 'a'**

3. After C - h steps, tortoise comes to the number 0 + (C - h) in the cycle
4. After (C - h) * 2 steps, hare comes to h + (C - h) * 2 = C + C - h = (C - h) in the cycle
5. a = C - h

**From now on we create 2 pointers with 1 step/turn, p goes from a and q goes from the start point and when they meet it is the start of the cycle**

6. At that point, the tortoise goes (F + a) distance and hare goes (F + nc + a) distance
7. **F + a = nc**
8. After F turns, q comes to the **start of the cycle** but we do not know yet.
9. After F turns, p also goes F steps and p's location is at a + F = nc 
10. That is p traverse n cycles and come to **the start of the cycle too**. And they will meet there.

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode intersect = getIntersect(head);
        if (intersect == null) {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode p = head;
        ListNode q = intersect;
        while (p != q) {
            p = p.next;
            q = q.next;
        }
        return p;
    }
    
    // get the node when they meet each other -- 'a'
    public ListNode getIntersect(ListNode head) {
        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head;
        
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null) {
            hare = hare.next.next;
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            if (hare == tortoise) {
                return hare;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
