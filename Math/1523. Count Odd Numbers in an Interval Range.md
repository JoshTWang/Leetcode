#### Easy problem

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if (low % 2 == 0 && high % 2 == 0) {
            return (high - low) / 2;
        } else if (low % 2 == 1 && high % 2 == 1) {
            return (high - low) / 2 + 1;
        } else {
            return (high - low + 1) / 2;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Another tricky solution

```java
class Solution {
    // total count is count(high) - count(low - 1)
    // the count of odd numbers between 1 and low - 1 is low / 2
    // the count of odd numbers between 1 and high is (high + 1 ) / 2
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return (high + 1) / 2 - low / 2;
    }
}
```
