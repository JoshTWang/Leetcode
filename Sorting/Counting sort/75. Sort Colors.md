The problem is known as [Dutch National Flag Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) and first was proposed by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra).

#### My counting sort

```java
class Solution {
    // count sort -- in place 2 passes
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        // step 1) count
        int[] count = new int[3];
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num] += 1;
        }
        
        // step 2) overwrite
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 1) {
            if (count[0] > 0) {
                nums[i] = 0;
                count[0] -= 1;
            } else if (count[1] > 0) {
                nums[i] = 1;
                count[1] -= 1;
            } else {
                nums[i] = 2;
                count[2] -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### In place one pass

>   - If `nums[curr] = 2` : swap `curr`th and `p2`th elements. Move pointer `p2` to the left.

```java
class Solution {
    // 3 pointer
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int p0 = 0;
        int p2 = nums.length - 1;
        int curr = 0;
        while (curr <= p2) {
            if (nums[curr] == 0) {
                swap(nums, p0, curr);
                p0 += 1;
                curr += 1; // why curr += 1? Because all the nums between p0 and curr is 1, so we don't need to check 1 again
            } else if (nums[curr] == 1) {
                curr += 1;
            } else {
                swap(nums, p2, curr);
                p2 -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```
