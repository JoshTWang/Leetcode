## 584. Find Customer Referee

---

MySQL uses three-valued logic

- TRUE
- FALSE
- UNKNOWN. 

Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators to specifically check for NULL.



```sql
SELECT name FROM customer
WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
```
