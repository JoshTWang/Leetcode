## 446.Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence

413 --> subarray

446 --> subsequence

#### Answer's

```java
class Solution {
    /* DP
    _ _ _ _ 6 _ _ _ _ 11 _ _ _ 
            j         i
    When we want to calculate number of arithmetic subsequences ending at ith, we need need to check all j's (0 <= j < i). For each j, we know that diff = 11 - 6 = 5, so a valid subsequence will always be 1 6 11, -4 1 6 11 ... As long as we can keep track T(j, d) (in this case: all subseqence ending at jth(6) and have common difference = 11 - 6 = 5, we just need to add T(j, d) to T(i, d) where d = nums[i] - nums[j]
