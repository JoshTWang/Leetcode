## 1259. Handshakes That Don't Cross



--- Hard and Interesting

```java
class Solution {
    // interesting DP
    final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    public int numberOfWays(int numPeople) {
        // dp[n] be the number of ways that 2n people can handshake.
        int[] dp = new int[numPeople / 2 + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // no people, base case
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= numPeople / 2; i += 1) {
            // use random one people as a pivot, he will turn for every other person to have a handshake
            // all people to the left, all people to the right will be two subproblems
            // Varient: people to the left and people to the right should be even

            for (int j = 0; j < i; j += 1) {
                int left = dp[j];
                int right = dp[i - j - 1];
                dp[i] += (long)left * right % MOD;
                dp[i] %= MOD;
            }
        }
        return dp[numPeople / 2];
    }
}
