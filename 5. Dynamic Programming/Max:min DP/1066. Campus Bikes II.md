### Backtracking

```java
class Solution {
    int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    private int manhDist(int[] worker, int[] bike) {
        return Math.abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + Math.abs(worker[1] - bike[1]);
    }

    private void backtracking(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes, int currWorker, int currDist, boolean[] visited) {
        if (currWorker >= workers.length) {
            // all the workers are assigned bikes
            res = Math.min(res, currDist);
            return;
        }

        if (currDist >= res)
            // no need to explore
            return;
        
        for (int currBike = 0; currBike < bikes.length; currBike += 1) {
            if (!visited[currBike]) {
                visited[currBike] = true;
                int d = manhDist(workers[currWorker], bikes[currBike]);
                backtracking(workers, bikes, currWorker + 1, currDist + d, visited);
                visited[currBike] = false;
            }
        }
    }


    public int assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        backtracking(workers, bikes, 0, 0, new boolean[bikes.length]);
        return res;
    }
}
```



#### Bit manipulation + dp

```java
class Solution {
    /* dp + Bit Manipulation
    10 bikes: 0,000,000,000 mask
    0100,001,000 represents the 3rd and 8th bikes are visited
    mask & (1 << currBike): check whether the (currBike)th is visited
    mask | (1 << currBike): mark the (currBike)th is visited
    */
    int[] memo = new int[1024];
    private int manhDist(int[] worker, int[] bike) {
        return Math.abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + Math.abs(worker[1] - bike[1]);
    }

    private int dp(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes, int currWorker, int mask) {
        if (currWorker >= workers.length) {
            // all the workers are assigned bikes
            return 0;
        }

        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if (memo[mask] == -1) {
            for (int currBike = 0; currBike < bikes.length; currBike += 1) {
                if ((mask & (1 << currBike)) == 0) {
                    // unvisited
                    int d = manhDist(workers[currWorker], bikes[currBike]);
                    res = Math.min(res, 
                    d + dp(workers, bikes, currWorker + 1, mask | (1 << currBike)));
                }
            }
            memo[mask] = res;
        }
        return memo[mask];
    }


    public int assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
        return dp(workers, bikes, 0, 0);
    }
}
