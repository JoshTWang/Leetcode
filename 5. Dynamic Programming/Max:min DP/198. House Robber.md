[Example 198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/dynamic-programming/631/strategy-for-solving-dp-problems/4097/)

##### Using DP?

* ***maximum** amount of money*
* current decisions will **affect** which options are available for our future decisions
  * should not rob adjacent houses

##### Thinking

1. A **function or array** that answers the problem for a given state

   * **state variables**: index of a house -- an integer (If the problem had an added constraint such as "*you are only allowed to rob up to k houses*", then k would be another necessary state variable.)

   * **dp[i]** or **dp(i)** represents the maximum amount of money you can rob up to and including house i.

   * To solve the original problem, we will just need to return dp[nums.length - 1] or dp(nums.length - 1), depending if we do bottom-up or top-down.

2. A **recurrence relation** to transition between states
   *  For any recurrence relation, a good place to start is to think about a **general state** (in this case, let's say we're at the house at index i), and use information from the problem description to think about **how other states relate to the current one.**

If we are at some house, logically, we have 2 options: we can choose to rob this house, or we can choose to not rob this house.

* If we decide not to rob the house, then we don't gain any money. Whatever money we had from the previous house is how much money we will have at this house - which is dp(i - 1).

* If we decide to rob the house, then we gain \text{nums[i]}nums[i] money. However, this is only possible if we did not rob the previous house. This means the money we had when arriving at this house is the money we had from the previous house without robbing it, which would be however much money we had 2 houses ago,dp(i - 2). After robbing the current house, we will have dp(i - 2) + nums[i] money.

`dp(i)=max(dp(i - 1), dp(i - 2) + nums[i]) `

3. **Base cases**

1. `dp(0) = nums[0]`
2. `dp(1)=max(nums[0], nums[1])`



#### Top down

```java
class Solution {
    private HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
    private int[] nums;
    
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        return dp(nums.length - 1);
    }
    
    private int dp(int i) {
        // base case
        if (i == 0) {
            return nums[0];
        } else if (i == 1) {
            return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        }
        
        // recurrence relation
        if (!memo.containsKey(i)) {
            memo.put(i, Math.max(dp(i - 1), dp(i - 2) + nums[i]));
        }
        
        return memo.get(i);
    }
}
```

#### Bottom up iteration

```java
class Solution {    
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i += 1) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
                
        return dp[nums.length - 1];
    }
}
```
