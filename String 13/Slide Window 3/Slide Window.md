* A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems.
* A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. [i, j)[*i*,*j*) (left-closed, right-open). 
* A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction.
  *  For example, if we slide [i, j)[*i*,*j*) to the right by 11 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1)[*i*+1,*j*+1) (left-closed, right-open).
