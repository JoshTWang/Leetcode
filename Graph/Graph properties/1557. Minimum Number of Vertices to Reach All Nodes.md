```java
class Solution {
    // Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable: It means that if the n = 8 and res = {0, 3}, we can reach all the nodes 0-8 in the graph starting from 0 or 3.
    // A node that does not have any incoming edge can only be reached by itself, so the result must contain this node
    // Any other node with incoming edges can be reached from some other node.
    // We only have to count the number of nodes with zero incoming edges.
    public List<Integer> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, List<List<Integer>> edges) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] reachable = new boolean[n]; // reachable by other nodes
        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            int outdegree = edge.get(0);
            int indegree = edge.get(1);
            reachable[indegree] = true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
            if (!reachable[i]) {
                res.add(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
