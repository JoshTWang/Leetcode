#### Backwards

```java
class Solution {
    // backwards and forwards would the same result.
    // from x to y we can multiply or subtract -- Nondeterministic
    // from y to x we can divide or add -- deterministic
    // why we solve this backwards
    // because we can't divide by 2 if the num is an odd, so each time we meet an odd we should always add 1
    // Each time we meet an even we could either divide or add
    // 8 -> 3 of course we should divide first
    // 8 -> 7 8/2 + 3 = 4 steps --- (8 + 6) / 2 = 7 steps we should also divide first then add to the target because the earlier addition will be diminished by later divisions, so we need to divide first and the latter add will be more powerful
    // so we should solve this problem backwards and divide as long as possible
    public int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (startValue < target) {
            steps += 1;
            if (target % 2 == 1) {
                target += 1;
            } else {
                target /= 2;
            }
        }
        return steps + startValue - target;
    }
}
```
