Just [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number)



#### Naive -- Basic recursion

* Without the memoization, this isn't actually dynamic programming.
* It's just **basic** recursion. Only after we optimize our solution by adding memoization to avoid repeated computations can it be called DP.

```java
class Solution {
    // A function that represents the answer to the problem for a given state
    private int dp(int i) {
        if (i <= 2) return i; // Base cases
        return dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2); // Recurrence relation
    }
    
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        return dp(n);
    }
}

/**
 * Bad idea
 * Time O(2^n) --- Tree with n levels
 * 1 + 2 + 4 + 2^n
 * For example
 * 10 == 9 + 8
 * 9 == 8 + 7
 * 8 == 7 + 6
 * We calculate the same level too many times
 *
 * We can recurse with memorization
 * But it is just Fibonacci
 */
```

#### Top down dp

* **Memoization** means caching results from function calls and then referring to those results in the future instead of recalculating them. This is usually done with a hashmap or an array.
* Using a hashmap isn't necessarily bad practice as some DP problems will require one, and they're hassle-free to use as you don't need to worry about **sizing** an array correctly

```java
class Solution {
    private HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    
    private int dp(int i) {
        if (i <= 2) return i;
        // Instead of just returning dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2), calculate it once and then
        // store it inside a hashmap to refer to in the future
        if (!memo.containsKey(i)) {
            memo.put(i, dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2));
        }
        
        return memo.get(i);
    }
    
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        return dp(n);
    }
}
```
