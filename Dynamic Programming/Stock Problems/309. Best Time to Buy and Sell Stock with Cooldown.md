```java

    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length + 2][2]; 
        // dp(i, holding) return the max profit starting at ith day
        // base case i = prices.length or prices.length + 1 because we may have cooldown and jump to the next base case
        
        for (int i = prices.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
            for (int holding = 0; holding < 2; holding += 1) {

                if (holding == 1) {
                    //sell
                    doSomething = prices[i] + dp[i + 2][0];
                } else {
                    // buy
                    doSomething = -prices[i] + dp[i + 1][1];
                }
                dp[i][holding] = Math.max(doSomething, doNothing);

#### DP with State Machine

[math for all stock problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/discuss/75924/Most-consistent-ways-of-dealing-with-the-series-of-stock-problems)

* Three states
  * held
  * sold
  * reset: Due to the cooldown rule, after the `sold` state, the agent can not immediately acquire any stock, but is *forced* into the `reset` state

* Three actions
  * sell
  * buy
  * reset

![graph of state transition](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/Figures/309/309_graph.png)

* sold[*i*]: the previous state of `sold` can only be `held`
* held[*i*]: the previous state of `held` could also be `held`, *i.e.* one does no transaction. Or its previous state could be `reset`, from which state, one can acquire a stock at the current price point.
* reset[*i*]: the previous state of `reset` could either be `reset` or `sold`. 

```java
class Solution {
  	// we define three state arrays: sold, held, reset and update them one by one
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int sold = Integer.MIN_VALUE, held = Integer.MIN_VALUE, reset = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            int preSold = sold;

            sold = held + price;
            held = Math.max(held, reset - price);
            reset = Math.max(reset, preSold);
        }

        return Math.max(sold, reset);
    }
}
