#### Path problems for DP

* **Matrices** as part of the input
* **Rules** for moving through the matrix



* Typically, DP will be applicable when the allowed movement is constrained in a way that prevents moving "backwards", for example if we are only allowed to move **down and right**.
* If we are allowed to move in all 4 directions, then it might be a graph/BFS problem instead.
