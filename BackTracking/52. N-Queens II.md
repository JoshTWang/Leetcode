#### Basic Backtracking

```java
class Solution {
    // We can easily find this problem should be a backtracking problem
    // The key idea is how to decide whether (current row, current col) is_not_under_attack, especially diagonals and antiDiagonals
    // We should find a way to change the board state and remove back to the prev state easily. -- HashSet to store all the underattacked grids is hard to move back
    // We can find that all the grid in the same diagonals (row - col) is the same
    //                  all the grid in the same antiDiagonals (row + col) is the same
    // So we can use a hashset to store all the value of row - col and row + col
    
    private int size;
    
    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        size = n;
        return backtrack(0, new HashSet<>(), new HashSet<>(), new HashSet<>());
    }
    
    private int backtrack(int row, Set<Integer> diagonals, 
                          Set<Integer> antiDiagonals, Set<Integer> cols) {
        // base case -- N queens have been placed
        if (row == size) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int solutions = 0;
        for (int col = 0; col < size; col += 1) {
            
            int currDiagonal = row - col;
            int currAntiDiagonal = row + col;
            
            if (cols.contains(col) || diagonals.contains(currDiagonal) 
                || antiDiagonals.contains(currAntiDiagonal)) {
                continue;
            }
            cols.add(col);
            diagonals.add(currDiagonal);
            antiDiagonals.add(currAntiDiagonal);
            
            solutions += backtrack(row + 1, diagonals, antiDiagonals, cols);
            
            // backtracking -- remove the this attempt and go to next attempt
            cols.remove(col);
            diagonals.remove(currDiagonal);
            antiDiagonals.remove(currAntiDiagonal);
        }
        return solutions;
    }
