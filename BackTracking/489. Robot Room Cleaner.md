#### So similar to DFS

```java
class Solution {
    // What is the different between this backtracking and dfs?
    // This problem can not revert to previous state on its own, we need to define a go back function
    // the key part is to coordinate the direction between robot and our statemap. If we want to go up, we need to make sure the robot is facing up
    
    // clockwise: 0 up - 1 right - 2 down - 3 left
    int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}};
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet();
    Robot robot;
    
    // backtrack
    private void goBack() {
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.move();
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.turnRight();
    }
    
    public void cleanRoom(Robot robot) {
        this.robot = robot;
        backtracking(0, 0, 0); // at first face up
    }
    
    // Manually dfsï¼Œ backtracking is used to back track the robot state. We can just use dfs if we don't have the robot.
    private void backtracking(int row, int col, int direction) {
        robot.clean();
        visited.add(row + " " + col);
        
        // up - right - down - left
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i += 1) {
            int newDirection = (direction + i) % 4;
            // if we are facing right, the first newDirection will also be facing right
            int newRow = row + directions[newDirection][0];
            int newCol = col + directions[newDirection][1];
            
            if (!visited.contains(newRow + " " + newCol) && robot.move()) {
                backtracking(newRow, newCol, newDirection);
                goBack();
            }
            robot.turnRight();
        }
    }
}
```
