#### Montonic Stack

```java
class Solution {
    // why stack not queue?
    // because we in [80 50 60] -- when we are working on 60, we would update 50's answer -- if we use queue, we will not update anything    
    
    // Monotonic stack
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        
        Stack<Integer> monStack = new Stack<>();
        // the stack store the days which have not find the warmer temperature
        // invarant : all the days of temperature in the stack keep decreasing order
        for (int currDay = 0; currDay < n; currDay += 1) {
            int currTemp = temperatures[currDay];
            // we still have temp not find the next warmer day && currTemp is warmer than before -- we need to update the answer now
            while (!monStack.isEmpty() && currTemp > temperatures[monStack.peek()]) {
                int prevDay = monStack.pop();
                res[prevDay] = currDay - prevDay;
            }
            monStack.push(currDay);
        }
        
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

#### Backwards + use information before

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        // We looking from back
        // We use the information we got before to help us improve the efficiency
        int n = temperatures.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        int hottest = 0; // to make sure we will find a answer in the array
        
        for (int currDay = n - 1; currDay >= 0; currDay -= 1) {
            int currTemp = temperatures[currDay];
            if (currTemp >= hottest) {
                hottest = currTemp;
                continue;
            }
            int days = 1;
          	// we skip the days that is not possible warmer than the currentDay
            while (temperatures[currDay + days] <= currTemp) {
                days += answer[currDay + days];
            }
            answer[currDay] = days;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
