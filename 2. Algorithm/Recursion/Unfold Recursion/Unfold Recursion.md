* Recursion could be elegant and intuitive.
* But sometimes we should convert a recursive algorithm to iterative one.

##### Risk of stackoverflow

* Convert to tail recursion

##### Efficiency

* The additional cost of function calls
* Duplicate calculation
  * memo

##### Complexity

* We can use a data structure of stack or queue which replaces the role of the system call stack during recursion.
