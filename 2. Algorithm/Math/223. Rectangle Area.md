## [223. Rectangle Area](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/)



#### My Math

```java
class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1);
        int area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);
        
        // compute overlapping area
        int length = 0;
        for (int x = ax1; x <= ax2; x += 1) {
            if (x >= bx1 && x <= bx2)
                length += 1;
        }
        
        int width = 0;
        for (int y = ay1; y <= ay2; y += 1) {
            if (y >= by1 && y <= by2)
                width += 1;
        }
        if (length <= 1 || width <= 1) {
            return area1 + area2;
        } else {
            return area1 + area2 - (width - 1) * (length - 1);
        }
    }
}
```



#### Better Math

```java
class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int areaOfA = (ay2 - ay1) * (ax2 - ax1);
        int areaOfB = (by2 - by1) * (bx2 - bx1);

        // calculate x overlap
        int left = Math.max(ax1, bx1);
        int right = Math.min(ax2, bx2);
        int xOverlap = right - left;

        // calculate y overlap
        int top = Math.min(ay2, by2);
        int bottom = Math.max(ay1, by1);
        int yOverlap = top - bottom;

        int areaOfOverlap = 0;
        // if the rectangles overlap each other, then calculate
        // the area of the overlap
        if (xOverlap > 0 && yOverlap > 0) {
            areaOfOverlap = xOverlap * yOverlap;
        }

        // areaOfOverlap is counted twice when in the summation of
        // areaOfA and areaOfB, so we need to subtract it from the
        // total, to get the toal area covered by both the rectangles
        int totalArea = areaOfA + areaOfB - areaOfOverlap;

        return totalArea;
    }
}
```
