```java

        Arrays.sort(people);
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int count = people.length;
        // find the first heavy person that can share the boat
        while (right < people.length && people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
            right += 1;
        }
        right -= 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
                // each time we find a group we minus count by 1
                count -= 1;
                left += 1;
                right -= 1;
            } else {

#### Concise two pointer

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        // we just greedily consider how to pair the boat.
        // We need to pair them as much as possible. We should pair the heavist people first because if we pair two light person first, the heavier person could not find the partner
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int left = 0, right = people.length - 1;
        int res = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            // still have people
            res += 1;
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
                // we can have a pair, the lightest person is on boat.
                left += 1;
            }
            right -= 1;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
