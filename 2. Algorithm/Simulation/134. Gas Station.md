Need review

#### Brute force -- O($n^2$)

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n = gas.length;

        // iterate each start station
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
            int currGas = 0;
            int countStation = 0;
            int j = i;

            // iterate the whole route
            while (countStation < n) {
                currGas += gas[j % n] - cost[j % n];
                if (currGas < 0) {
                    break;
                }
                countStation += 1;
                j += 1;
            }
            if (countStation == n && currGas >= 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```



#### Simulation

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n = gas.length;
        int totalGas = 0; // total remaining gas
        int currGas = 0;  // remaining gas from startStation
        int startStation = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
            totalGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
            currGas += gas[i] - cost[i]; 
            if (currGas < 0) {
                startStation = i + 1;
                currGas = 0;
            }  
        }
        /* 
        Why totalGas >= 0 is sufficient to say we will have a start station?
        After the loop, we can claim that we have enough gas travel from startStation to the last Station and currGas >= 0
        And if the totalGas also >= 0, we know will know that [the gas consumed before startStation] + [currGas] >= 0 which means currGas can cover the gas consumed before.
        */
        return totalGas >= 0 ? startStation : -1;
    }
}
```
