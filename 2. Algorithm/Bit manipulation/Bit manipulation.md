#### Bits

* Bit stands for Binary Digit, a basic and smallest unit of data in a computer.
  * **Binary** representation is based on $1s$ and $0s$
  * A **bit** represents a logical state with only 2 boolean values, either 0 or 1, as they are a 2 base number.
  * They

* We read binary number from the right to left

$$
1~~0~~1~~0 \\\
2^32^22^12^0
$$

* **Bit manipulation** is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits using bit-level (bitwise) operations. These bitwise operations are the heart of bit manipulation. They are primitive, fast actions that are used in improving the efficiency of a program.

#### Basics of Bit manipulation

| Operator | Name of operator       |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| &        | Bitwise AND            |
| \|       | Bitwise OR             |
| ~        | One's complement / Not |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR            |
| <<       | Left shift             |
| >>       | Right shift            |

* A **bitmask** is the data used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field. Using a mask, bits can be set either on/off or vice versa in a single bitwise operation.
