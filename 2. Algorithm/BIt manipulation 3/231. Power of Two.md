- How to get / isolate the rightmost 1-bit : `x & (-x)`.
- How to turn off (= set to 0) the rightmost 1-bit : `x & (x - 1)`.

#### Bitwise Operators : Get the Rightmost 1-bit

> Two's complement: $−x = ¬x+1$
>
> $¬x$: revert all bits in $x$

> $x$ and $-x$ have just one bit in common - **the rightmost 1-bit**. 
>
> That means that `x & (-x)` would keep that rightmost 1-bit and set all the other bits to 0.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {        
        if (n == 0) return false;
        long x = (long) n;
        return (x & (-x)) == x;
    }
}
```

#### Bitwise operators : Turn off the Rightmost 1-bit

> `x & (x - 1)` is a way to set the rightmost 1-bit to zero
>
> ​	To subtract 1 means to change the rightmost 1-bit to 0 and to set all the lower bits to 1.
>
> ​	Now AND operator: the rightmost 1-bit will be turned off because `1 & 0 = 0`, and all the lower bits as well.

```java
class Solution {    
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return false;
        long x = (long) n;
        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0; // 100000 -> 000000
    }
}
```
