#### Normal

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num -= 1;
            }
            steps += 1;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```

#### Bit manipulation

> The `0`s took **one** step to remove, and the `1`s took **two** steps to remove.

```java
public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
    
    // Get the binary for num, as a String.
    String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(num);
    
    int steps = 0;
    // Iterate over all the bits in the binary string.
    for (char bit : binaryString.toCharArray()) {
        if (bit == '1') { // If the bit is a 1 
            steps = steps + 2; // Then it'll take 2 to remove.
        } else { // bit == '0'
            steps = steps + 1; // Then it'll take 1 to remove.
        }
    }

    // We need to subtract 1, because the last bit was over-counted.
    return steps - 1;
}
```

#### Counting Bits with Bitwise Operators

```java
public int numberOfSteps(int num) {

    // We need to handle this as a special case, otherwise it'll return -1.
    if (num == 0) return 0;

    int steps = 0;

    for (int powerOfTwo = 1; powerOfTwo <= num; powerOfTwo = powerOfTwo * 2) {
        // Apply the bit mask to check if the bit at "powerOfTwo" is a 1.
        if ((powerOfTwo & num) != 0) {
            steps = steps + 2;
        } else {
            steps = steps + 1;
        }
    }

    // We need to subtract 1, because the last bit was over-counted.
    return steps - 1;
}
```
