* The key idea is we first **convert all the numbers to even** so that all of them can't be **increase** anymore.
* Then we using **heap** to check whether we can **decrease the Maximum** to getter a better result
  * It doesn't mean that we as long as we decrease the max we will get a better result.
    * 6 - 5 -- 3 - 5 its getting worse
  * So we need to build a variable called **minDeviation**
  * And we need the **minimum** variable all the time to compute the minDeviation so we have to build the variable minimum when we build the heap

#### Copy the answer idea

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeviation(int[] nums) {
        // because we need a maxheap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> evens = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int minimum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        // We put all the evens into our PQ
        // and all the odds multiply 2 and then put into PQ 
        // so that all the nums in PQ is even -- that means we can't not increase minimum anymore, we can only decrease the maximum
        for (int n: nums) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                evens.add(n);
                minimum = Math.min(n, minimum);
            } else {
                evens.add(2 * n);
                minimum = Math.min(2 * n, minimum);
            }
        }
        int minDeviation = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (!evens.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = evens.remove();
            // why each time we update the minDeviation
            // for 6 - 5 the minDeviation is 1
            // but it can continue moving on the 3 - 5 and the Deviation is 2
            minDeviation = Math.min(curr - minimum, minDeviation);
            if (curr % 2 == 0) {
                curr /= 2;
                evens.add(curr);
                minimum = Math.min(minimum, curr);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return minDeviation;
    }
    // even -- divide -- get smaller -- find the smallest even number
    // odd -- multipy -- get larger -- find the largest odd number
    
    // we can not use the minheap to first decrease all numbers to their minimum because we can decrease a 4 into 1 but can not turn 1 to the original value 4 back.
}
