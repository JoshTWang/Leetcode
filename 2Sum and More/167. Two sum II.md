##### Input Array is Sorted

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int first = 0;
        int second = numbers.length - 1;
        while (numbers[first] + numbers[second] != target) {
            if (numbers[first] + numbers[second] < target) {
                first += 1;
            } else if (numbers[first] + numbers[second] > target) {
                second -= 1;
            }
        }
        return new int[] { first + 1, second + 1 };
    }
}
```

- Time complexity: O*(*n*). The input array is traversed at most once. Thus the time complexity is O*(*n*).
- Space complexity: O(1). We only use additional space to store two indices and the sum, so the space complexity is O(1).



### Explanation

* We set the "first" the first item in the array, "second" the last item in the array. Because it is sorted array. So We can scan N times to find our exact group.
