#### My O(m * n) space approach

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;
        int[][] res = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i += 1) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j += 1) {
                int liveNeigh = 0;
                for (int[] dir: directions) {
                    int newRow = i + dir[0];
                    int newCol = j + dir[1];
                    if (0 <= newRow && newRow < m && 0 <= newCol && newCol < n) {
                        if(board[newRow][newCol] == 1) {
                            liveNeigh += 1;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if(board[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (liveNeigh < 2 || liveNeigh > 3) {
                        res[i][j] = 0;
                    } else {
                        res[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                } else {
                    if(liveNeigh == 3) {
                        res[i][j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        res[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // copy the res to the original board
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i += 1) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j += 1) {
                board[i][j] = res[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### In-place approach

* change 2 states to 4 states

Consider as liveNeigh

* Still live -- 1 -- live in the end
* live -> die -- -1 

Consider as dieNeigh

* Still die -- 0
* Die --> live 2 -- live in the end

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {

        // Neighbors array to find 8 neighboring cells for a given cell
        int[] neighbors = {0, 1, -1};

        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;

        // Iterate through board cell by cell.
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {

                // For each cell count the number of live neighbors.
                int liveNeighbors = 0;

                for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

                        if (!(neighbors[i] == 0 && neighbors[j] == 0)) {
                            int r = (row + neighbors[i]);
                            int c = (col + neighbors[j]);

                            // Check the validity of the neighboring cell.
                            // and whether it was originally a live cell.
                            if ((r < rows && r >= 0) && (c < cols && c >= 0) && (Math.abs(board[r][c]) == 1)) {
                                liveNeighbors += 1;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }

                // Rule 1 or Rule 3
                if ((board[row][col] == 1) && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
                    // -1 signifies the cell is now dead but originally was live.
                    board[row][col] = -1;
                }
                // Rule 4
                if (board[row][col] == 0 && liveNeighbors == 3) {
                    // 2 signifies the cell is now live but was originally dead.
                    board[row][col] = 2;
                }
            }
        }

        // Get the final representation for the newly updated board.
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
                if (board[row][col] > 0) {
                    board[row][col] = 1;
                } else {
                    board[row][col] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Follow-up

We have a gigantic matrix with a very few live cells.

* It would make much more sense to actually save the location of only the live cells and then apply the 4 rules accordingly using only these live cells.

Infinite board

* At max we will have 3 rows in memory. We will keep discarding rows that are processed and then we will keep reading new rows from the file, one at a time
