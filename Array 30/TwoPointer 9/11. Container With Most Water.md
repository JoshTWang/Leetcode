#### Classical Two Pointer

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int res = 0;
        // two pointer
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            res = Math.max(res, h * (right - left));
            
            // key part is which pointer should we move
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                right -= 1;
            } else {
                left += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    // Proof by contradiction: If we move the larger one, we cannot increase the height for the simple reason that we are always limited by the shortest. So even if the large side become larger, we will always use the short length as our height.
}
