#### My two arrays

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        n += 1; // 1-index
        int[] qualified = new int[n]; // 0 is qualified
        int[] believers = new int[n];
        for (int[] t : trust) {
            int trusting = t[0];
            int trusted = t[1];
            qualified[trusting] += 1;
            believers[trusted] += 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 1) {
            if (qualified[i] == 0 && believers[i]== n - 2) { // (n - 1) - 1: original n = n - 1 && exclude himself
                return i;
            }

#### Answer's two arrays

> In graph theory, we say the **outdegree** of a vertex (person) is the number of directed edges going out of it. For this graph, the outdegree of the vertex represents the number of other people that person `trust`s.
>
> Likewise, we say that the **indegree** of a vertex (person) is the number of directed edges going *into* it. So here, it represents the number of people *trusted by* that person.

```java
public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
    
    if (trust.length < N - 1) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    int[] indegrees = new int[N + 1];
    int[] outdegrees = new int[N + 1];

    for (int[] relation : trust) {
        outdegrees[relation[0]]++;
        indegrees[relation[1]]++; 
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (indegrees[i] == N - 1 && outdegrees[i] == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

#### Answer's one array

```java
class Solution {
    // the solution works because all the trust relation is unique 
    public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) { 
        if (trust.length < N - 1) {
            return -1;
        }

        int[] trustScores = new int[N + 1];

        for (int[] relation : trust) {
            trustScores[relation[0]]--; // - 0 scores
            trustScores[relation[1]]++; // + (n - 1) scores
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (trustScores[i] == N - 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
