##### Backgrounds

> 1. The **distance** between two nodes is the number of edges that connect the two nodes.
> 2. The **height** of a tree can be defined as the *maximum distance* between the root and all its leaf nodes.
> 3. If we view the graph as an *area of circle*, and the leaf nodes as the *peripheral* of the circle, then what we are looking for are actually the **[centroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)** (质心) of the circle, *i.e.* nodes that is close to all the peripheral nodes (leaf nodes).
>    * For the tree-alike graph, the number of centroids is **no more than 2**.
>      * If the number of nodes is **even**, then there would be two centroids.
>      * If the number of nodes is **odd**, then there would be only one centroid.

##### Algorithm -- why is it similar to [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii)

> Given the above algorithm, we could implement it via the *Breadth First Search* (BFS) strategy, to trim the leaf nodes layer by layer (*i.e.* level by level).
>
> - Initially, we would build a graph with the *[adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)* from the input.
> - We then create a queue which would be used to hold the **leaf nodes**.
> - At the beginning, we put all the current leaf nodes into the queue.
> - We then run a loop until there is only **two nodes** left in the graph.
> - At each iteration, we remove the current leaf nodes from the queue. While removing the nodes, we also remove the edges that are linked to the nodes. As a consequence, some of the non-leaf nodes would become leaf nodes. And these are the nodes that would be trimmed out in the next iteration.
> - The iteration terminates when there are no more than two nodes left in the graph, which are the desired ***centroids*** nodes.

#### Topological sort

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {        
        // edge cases
        if (n < 2) {
            ArrayList<Integer> centroids = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                centroids.add(i);
            return centroids;
        }
        
        // step 1) build the adjList
        ArrayList<Set<Integer>> adjSet = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1)
            adjSet.add(new HashSet<>());
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            Integer u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            adjSet.get(u).add(v);
            adjSet.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        // step 2) add all the leaves(with one edge) to the queue
        List<Integer> leaves = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1)
            if (adjSet.get(i).size() == 1)
                leaves.add(i);
        
        // step 3) topological sort: trim the leaves until reaching the centroids
        int remaining = n;
        while (remaining > 2) { // 1 or 2 centorids for all the trees
            remaining -= leaves.size();
            List<Integer> newLeaves = new LinkedList<>();
            for (Integer leaf : leaves) {
                Integer branch = adjSet.get(leaf).iterator().next(); // get the element in the hashset
                adjSet.get(branch).remove(leaf); // trim the leaf
                if (adjSet.get(branch).size() == 1)
                    newLeaves.add(branch);
            }
            leaves = newLeaves;
        }
        return leaves;
    }
}
```
