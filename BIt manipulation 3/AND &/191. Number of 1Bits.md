#### My solution

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int mask = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i += 1) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                count += 1;
            }
            mask = mask << 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Second solution

* The key idea here is to realize that for any number $n$, doing a bit-wise AND of $n$ and $n - 1$ flips the least-significant1-bit in $n$ to 0.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            sum++;
            n &= (n - 1);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
