## 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

---

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        // step 1) Sort the balloons by x_end
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1],b[1]));

        // step 2) Greedy shoot as right as possible
        // for curr balloons [x_start, x_end], we should choose a point to shoot at. Only if we choose the right most x_end we may have a chance to shot as many balloons as possible, since all the latter balloons would be lefter than current one

        int currArrow = points[0][1];
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i += 1) {
            if (points[i][0] <= currArrow) {
                continue;
            } else {
                // shoot a new arrow
                currArrow = points[i][1];
                res += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
