#### Comparable<> Interface

```java
class Solution {
    
    // private class implements Comparable
    private class WorkerBikePair implements Comparable<WorkerBikePair> {
        int workerIndex;
        int bikeIndex;

        @Override
        public int compareTo(WorkerBikePair other) {
            if (this.distance != other.distance) {
                // Prioritize the one having smaller distance
                return this.distance - other.distance;
            } else if (this.workerIndex != other.workerIndex) {
                // Prioritize according to the worker index
                return this.workerIndex - other.workerIndex;
            } else {

    //return the Manhattan distance
    private int findDistance(int[] worker, int[] bike) {

    }
    
    
    public int[] assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        List<WorkerBikePair> list = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // sort the list

        boolean bikeStatus[] = new boolean[bikes.length]; 
        // store whether the bike is already paired
        int workerStatus[] = new int[workers.length]; 
        Arrays.fill(workerStatus, -1);
        // store the information of the pairs
        
        int count = 0;

            int worker = wbp.workerIndex;

    }
}

#### Bucket Sort

```java
class Solution {
  	// We do not even need to sort, because we add the pairs with the same distance in the right order. The first pair will always be the worker0 bike0s
  
    // Function to return the Manhattan distance
    int findDistance(int[] worker, int[] bike) {
        return Math.abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + Math.abs(worker[1] - bike[1]);
    }

    public int[] assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        int minDis = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        // Stores the list of (worker, bike) pairs corresponding to its distance
        Map<Integer, List<Pair<Integer, Integer>>> disToPairs = new HashMap();
        
        // Add the (worker, bike) pair corresponding to its distance list
        for (int worker = 0; worker < workers.length; worker++) {
            for (int bike = 0; bike < bikes.length; bike++) {
                int distance = findDistance(workers[worker], bikes[bike]);
                
                disToPairs.putIfAbsent(distance, new ArrayList<>());
                
                disToPairs.get(distance).add(new Pair(worker, bike));
                minDis = Math.min(minDis, distance);
            }
        }
        
        int currDis = minDis;
        // Initialize all values to false, to signify no bikes have been taken
        boolean bikeStatus[] = new boolean[bikes.length];

        int workerStatus[] = new int[workers.length];
        // Initialize all index to -1, to mark all the workers available
        Arrays.fill(workerStatus, -1);
        // Keep track of how many worker-bike pairs have been made
        int pairCount = 0;
        
        // Until all workers have not been assigned a bike
        while (pairCount != workers.length) {
             if (!disToPairs.containsKey(currDis)) {
                 currDis++;
                 continue;
             }

                int worker = pair.getKey();
                int bike = pair.getValue();

                if (workerStatus[worker] == -1 && !bikeStatus[bike]) {
                    // If both worker and bike are free, assign them to each other
                    bikeStatus[bike] = true;
                    workerStatus[worker] = bike;
                    pairCount++;

#### PriorityQueue

* We only maintain a PQ of size n, each time we pair a worker and a bike and made the bike unavailable. So next time we find the worker with already paired back we will pair the worker with next closest bike.s

```java
class Solution {
    // List of pairs (distance, bike index) for each bike corresponding to worker
    List<List<Pair<Integer, Integer>>> workerToBikeList = new ArrayList<>();
    // Stores the closest bike index, corresponding to the worker index
    int closestBikeIndex[] = new int[1001];
    
    // Class to store (worker, bike, distance)
    class WorkerBikePair {
        int workerIndex;
        int bikeIndex;
        int distance;

            this.distance = distance;
        }
    }

            closestBikeIndex[worker] = 0;
            
            // For each worker, add their closest bike to the priority queue
